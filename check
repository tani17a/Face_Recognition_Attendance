Algorithm
1.start
2. start with loading of images
3. encode thoes images and store those in another list 
4. store the name sequence by sequence in a list and copy the list as the total number of students that can be used later
5. start vedio capturing
6. make the frames of the captured vedio and make short frame of those by reducing the size
7. encode those frames and store the result
8. start a while loop to compare both the encodings that are of loaded images or faces and frame captured by webcam
9. find out the difference of the embedddings and store the index with minimum difference between the encodings 
10. use the above index to find out the name of the student by using the above total name list of the names
11. we got the name of the student ,delete that name from the list of total student
12. create a file of the current date name and store the present student name with the current time
13. to show the name of present student on the cam window start by making conditions for font and add to that of cv2.putext function
14. using waitkey set condition to exit the web comp
15. now close the file and free the webcam 
16. end
